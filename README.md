# This project is still WIP

# multiview
View multiple videos on the same page

# TODO:
- [x] Correct offsets when adding a new video after others have started playing  
- [x] Mouse controls (click to play/pause)  
- [x] Keyboard controls (seek, volume, play/pause, fullscreen)  
- [x] Disable overlay button
- [x] Focused view  
  - [x] Focused view drag-to-resize
- [x] Individual player actions (move up/down for focused view, Delete (with confirmation) for both)  
- [ ] Starting screen  
- [ ] (custom) Icons, title, text, PWA  
- [ ] Url middleware (remembers video urls and offsets)  
- [x] Move videos left/right in different views
- [ ] Animated playback controls (probably not though)  
- [ ] Pop-up indicators for mouse/keyboard controls (probably not, requires a relatively major rework)
- [ ] Buffering indicators (probably not, most players have their own)
